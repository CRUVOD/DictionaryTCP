## Dictionary TCP

Assignment 1 of COMP90015 Distributed Systems

Using a client-server architecture, a multi-threaded server is designed and implemented, that 
allows concurrent clients to search the meaning(s) of a word, add a new word, remove an 
existing word, adding or updating a specified meaning, and removing a specified meaning of 
a word.

The server implements the thread-per-connection model, allowing for multiple clients to 
connect and submit requests, whilst maintaining constant connections for each client.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Usage

Simply double click on the two jar files to start server and client respectively.
